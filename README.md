# DEV-SPACE

A comprehensive all-in-one platform for developers to post discussions, blogs, showcase profiles, and seek for jobs. (A combination of Reddit, StackOverflow, and LinkedIn)

This project is currently a work in progress. I created this project as an upgrade to my previous project [dev-sphere](https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere) in order to dive deeper into reactjs & nextjs.

The project is currently unable to be viewed due to local environment variables and api keys being used.

## Current tech stack being used:

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Reactjs](https://react.dev/)
- [Typescript/Javascript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
