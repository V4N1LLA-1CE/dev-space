# DEVSPACE

A comprehensive all-in-one platform for developers to post questions, showcase profiles, and seek for jobs. (A combination of Reddit, StackOverflow, and LinkedIn)

This project is currently a work in progress. I created this project as an upgrade to my previous project [dev-sphere](https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere) in order to dive deeper into reactjs & nextjs.

The project is currently unable to be viewed due to local environment variables and api keys being used.<br>
Here is a sneek peek!
