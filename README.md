# DEV-SPACE

This project is currently a work in progress. I created this project as an upgrade to my previous project [dev-sphere](https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere) in order to learn react and attempt to build a more complex application. 

## How to view this project?

1. Clone the project into your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-space.git ./dev-space
```


2. Change into project directory
```bash
cd dev-space/
```


3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```


4. Run the dev script
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
