# DEV-SPACE
---
This project is currently a work in progress. I created this project as an upgrade to my previous project [dev-sphere](https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere) in order to learn react and attempt to build a more complex application. 

## How to view this project?
---
```bash
# clone the repository into current directory
git clone https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-space.git ./dev-space
```

```bash
# change into project directory
cd dev-space
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
