# DEVSPACE

This is a fun little project I created during my university summer holidays. I created this project as an upgrade to my previous project [dev-sphere](https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere). I got this project idea from an open source repo and decided to put my own spin on it. This project taught me a little bit about NextJS and allowed me to practice my frontend skills using mainly react and tailwind.

Development of this project will not be continued as my university studies take priority. In addition to this, I have found interest in learning backend mainly with Java and Golang and will be continuing with that forward.

Here is a mini showcase!
